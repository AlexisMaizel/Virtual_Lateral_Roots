Experiences with segmentation/tracking tools

Here you can read about my experiences when using other segmentation
and tracking tools applied to our lateral root datasets.

----------------------------------------------------
Name: Ilastik
Availability: free
Task: Segmentation and Tracking
Source: http://ilastik.org/download.html
System: Win, Linux, Mac
----------------------------------------------------

Open-source segmentation and tracking tool of the image processing group of Fred Hamprecht.

CON
***

- still performance issues which makes interaction almost impossible with our datasets.

PRO
***

- a lot of powerful features: pixel classification -> segmentation, manual/semi-automatic tracking,
multicut -> extract cell contours and shapes, carving -> extract single 3D cell shapes, etc. .
- Membrane and nuclei segmentation of samples of Daniel's data and the new ones were really good
putting only a little effort in time and pixel drawing (<30 min).
- external segmentation results can be imported and ilastik's semi-automatic tracking can then
be applied.

----------------------------------------------------
Name: RACE
Availability: free
Task: Membrane Segmentation
Source: Stegmaier et al, Real-Time Three-Dimensional Cell Segmentation in Large-Scale
Microscopy Data of Developing Embryos, 2016
System: Win, Linux, Mac
----------------------------------------------------

Software for automated 3D cell segmentation consisting to two steps: slice-based watershed
segmentation and then fusion of 2D cell segments based on seed positions.

CON
***

- several bugs in version (newest version has a dependency on a commercial lib file on WIndows:
PICX20.dll but using an older version does not create some intermediate results etc. ).
- several parameters for which small changes require a rerun.
- after several EMails written to the authors, I received no answer.
- it takes a lot of time and tries to get some results which were not satisfying in my opinion
applied to our datasets.

PRO
***

- GUI interface which is user-friendly

----------------------------------------------------
Name: TGMM
Availability: free
Task: Segmentation and Tracking
Source: Amat et al, Efficient processing and analysis of large-scale light-sheet
microscopy data, 2015
System: Win, Linux (with CUDA GPU)
----------------------------------------------------

TGMM is a console based tool to generate a segmentation (persistence-based clustering) and
tracking using Gaussian mixture models. I integrated the execution of the tool into a MATLAB
file which will also automatically create and use the config files for several time steps and
datasets with respect to user-chosen parameters (mainTrackingInformationFromTGMM.m).

CON
***

- Usage of Win version since Linux version was not compilable
- Preprocessing step was required such that TGMM is able to identify cells. This step is actually
a segmentation itself (although TGMM has a segmentation which is not that good with our datasets)
and consists of the generation of "perfect" cell shapes which was done by thresholding and
clustering (see the MATLAB file mainNucleiSegmentation.m).
- No way to separate the segmentation and tracking step such that an own segmentation can be used;
so I ended up generating the "perfect" cell shapes, stored them in a TIFF file, and resegmented
then again in TGMM which ofc was able to identify them.
- Also after several EMails written to the authors, I received no answer about some issues of TGMM.
- It is also important that the "perfect" cell shapes are not allowed to have a single intensity
value for a complete cell but a radial gradient course of intensities; else TGMM fails in finding
cells.
-  The automatic tracking results were not that perfect and the methods fails when between
time steps t, t+1, t+2, a cell disappears in t+1, then also the cell track is lost

PRO
***

- when used with CUDA the performance is good (several minutes for 100 time steps)

----------------------------------------------------
Name: Imaris
Availability: commercial (played with demo that was provided to Alexis)
Task: Segmentation and Tracking
Source: http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaris
System: Win, Linux, Mac
----------------------------------------------------

Imaris is a commercial visualization and analysis tool that provides two ways to extract
cells: Either by detecting the cell boundaries or by using the membrane channel.

CON
***

- expensive
- Cell detection by using the membrane channel took more than 6 hours for a sample data and the
results were not that satisfying
- only usage of global thresholding which is not always the best choice

PRO
***

- very user-friendly interaction with everything and nice handling of intermediate and final results
- definition of region of interests (ROIs) to focus on specific regions
- automatic segmentation and tracking is applied to all time steps imported (as TIFF)
- Feture of splitting touching cells
- Manual modification of cell tracks (2D lineage trees) by drag and drop
- even missing cells in-between subsequent time steps were correctly included into cell tracks

----------------------------------------------------
Name: Trainable WEKA Segmentation
Availability: free, Fiji-Plugin
Task: Segmentation
Source: http://imagej.net/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation
System: Win, Linux, Mac
----------------------------------------------------

Free segmentation plugin in Fiji that perfoms a machine-learning based segmentation of images
(similar to ilastik).

CON
***

- does not run on multiple time steps while classifying cells and background; this means that
for one time steps the classifier has to be trained on the image which can then be stored.
- however, single "drawn" classifiers on an image cannot be modified when loading again.

PRO
***

- Provides kind of fast results with respect to ilastik
- lots of filter options
- works on 2D and 3D data
